# Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview:
In an increasingly digital age, credit card fraud poses a significant threat to consumers and financial institutions. This notebook presents a comprehensive approach to detecting potential credit card fraud using machine learning techniques.

Dataset: Transactions from 10,000 customers across 800 merchants from Jan 1st, 2019 - Dec 31st, 2020.

## Features:

* Data Preprocessing: Techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and standardize the dataset for optimal model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations to understand the distribution of legitimate vs. fraudulent transactions, highlighting the challenge of an imbalanced dataset.

* Key Insights:
  99.42% of transactions are legitimate.
  0.58% (7,506) transactions are fraudulent.
  Significant class imbalance with 'no fraud' transactions dominating.

* Feature Engineering: Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality while retaining essential information.

* Model Development:
Implementation and fine-tuning of several machine learning algorithms, including but not limited to:
Logistic Regression
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting
Neural Networks with TensorFlow

* Model Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC to assess model performance.

* Handling Class Imbalance: Techniques like SMOTE and random undersampling/oversampling to balance the dataset and improve predictive accuracy.

* Deployment: Steps to save and deploy the trained model for real-time transaction analysis.

* Usage: Ideal for data science enthusiasts, financial analysts, or anyone interested in understanding how machine learning can be applied to detect anomalies and protect against fraud.
